# Orchestrion-for-ZGV
Orchestrion for ZGV is a 3d library inspired by PianoShooter, written in ZGameEditor Visualizer based used in FL Studio.

At the moment there's only one instrument playable
while I'm working on more for the rest of the orchestra.

To install it you'll have to do it manually.

# Manual Install

To install Orchestrion, only extract the folder named Orchestrion then place that folder on the corresponding directory.

- On Windows, that will usually be `C:\Program Files (x86)\Image-Line\FL Studio\Plugins\Fruity\Effects\ZGameEditor Visualizer\Effects\Midi`.
- On Mac, it will usually be `/Applications/FL\ Studio\ 20.app/Contents/Resources/FL/Plugins/Fruity/Effects/ZGameEditor\ Visualizer/Effects/Midi`.

You can see more information at the [FL Studio manual.](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio-learning/fl-studio-online-manual/html/plugins/ZGameEditor%20Visualizer.htm#ZGE_addfx "FL Studio manual.")
